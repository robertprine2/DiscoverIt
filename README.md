# DiscoverIt

Discover It! is an app that promotes exploration and discovery. It is a great way to stay fit, build vocabulary, and learn about the world around you. 

Make discoveries by taking pictures of interesting things you find and describing them. You can also find discoveries that others have made and confirm their existence. Go and Discover It!

Getting Started

	Log In:
	1. Go to https://intense-reaches-75398.herokuapp.com/
	2. Log in with Google

	Discover It! Page:

		Once you have discovered something you would like to add to the database -

		1. Fill out the name, type of discovery, and description
		2. Click "Upload Picture and Submit"
		3. Click "Select Files" (or you can drag and drop images you would like to upload to the database)

		On a computer:

		4. Select the image you would like to upload and click "open"

		On a smart phone: 
		
		4. Click the camera icon to take a picture or click the documents icon to upload a file (There is a camcorder icon as well, but this isn't suggested due to file sizes)

			Camera -
			1. Take a picture of your discovery
			2. Click "OK" on the top right if you like the picture or "RETRY" on the top left if you want to try Camera - step 1 again

			Documents -
			1. Select the image you would like to upload
			**HINT** If you need to take a quick picture before you fill out the form (sometimes things aren't as stationary as we would like), just use your camera on your phone and then use the documents icon to upload it after you finish filling out the form.

		5. Wait for picture to be uploaded
		6. Rejoice! (You will now be able to find your picture in the "Find It!" page)

	Find It! Page:

		If you want to admire your discoveries or try to find other users discoveries -

		1. Use the search box to filter out discoveries based on what you are looking for: 
			- Type of discovery
			- Name
			- Any words in the description
			- Who discovered it
		2. Click on the image that you are close to (you need to be within ~1 mile of its location) on the Google Map if you are trying to Find It! or if you just want to learn more information about the discovery
		3. Click "Found It!" button
		4. Rejoice in your confirmation of someone elseâ€™s discovery
